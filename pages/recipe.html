          <p>Quick hummus recipe</p>

          <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>
    
          <p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.<p>

          <h4>Ingredients</h4>

          <ul>
              <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
              <li>175g of tahini</li>
              <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
              <li>Half a red pepper</li>
              <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
              <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
              <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Instructions</h4>

          <ol>
              <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
              <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
              <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
              <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste
                  <ul>
                      <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
                      <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
          </ol>

          <p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.<p>

        <section>
          <h4>Storage</h4>

          <p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p>
    
          <p>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
