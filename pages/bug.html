                    Debugging doesn't have to be scary though —  the key to being comfortable with writing and debugging any programming language or code is familiarity with both the language and the tools.

                            The way that browsers parse HTML is a lot more permissive than how programming languages are run, which is both a good and a bad thing.

                            HTML's element syntax is arguably a lot easier to understand than a "real programming language" like Rust, JavaScript, or Python.

                            HTML is not compiled into a different form before the browser parses it and shows the result (it is interpreted, not compiled).
