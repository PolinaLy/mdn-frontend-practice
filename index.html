        <p>This tiny project was created as a run through for MDN's frontend tutorials. The information was extracted as all the modules were gone through, and placed on webpages before you for author' personal use.</p>
        <p>The code, which shows up as text, for now, is easily descernible via developer tools. These webpages, and the information on them, were created for nothing more than simple practice.<br> Enjoy to your heart's content!</p>

        <h3>Important notice</h3>
  
        <p>On Sunday January 9th 2010, a <strong>gang of goths</strong> were
        spotted <em>stealing</em> several garden gnomes from a
        shopping center in downtown Milwaukee. They were
        all <strong>wearing green jumpsuits</strong> and <strong>silly hats</strong>, and
        seemed to be having a whale of a time. If anyone
        has any information about this incident, <strong><em>please
        contact the police now</em></strong>.</p>
