    <h1>Important notice</h1>

    <p>On Sunday January 9th 2010, a <strong>gang of goths</strong> were
    spotted <em>stealing</em> several garden gnomes from a
    shopping center in downtown Milwaukee. They were
    all <strong>wearing green jumpsuits</strong> and <strong>silly hats</strong>, and
    seemed to be having a whale of a time. If anyone
    has any information about this incident, <strong><em>please
    contact the police now</em></strong>.</p>
